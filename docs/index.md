# About Me

I'm currently a 7th semester student studying [Informatics Engineering](https://stei.itb.ac.id/en/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-informatics/){:target="\_blank"} at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/en/){:target="\_blank"}. My primary interests include DevOps and Cloud Computing, with a focus on task automation projects such as CI/CD and Data Engineering in my personal projects. In addition, I am currently enhancing my skills in Mathematics and Statistics to broaden my scope of knowledge and delve into the fields of Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
