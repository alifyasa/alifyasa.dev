My primary interests include DevOps and Cloud Computing, with a focus on task automation projects such as CI/CD and Data Engineering in my personal projects. In addition, I am currently enhancing my skills in Mathematics and Statistics to broaden my scope of knowledge and delve into the fields of Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
